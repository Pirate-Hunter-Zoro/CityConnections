## Project Information
*This project reads in a collection of edges from a file, which represent edges between nodes in a graph. Edges are defined explicitly in each location text file, which implicitly defines the nodes. There are no disconnected nodesâ€“all graphs are connected. <br>
The graph sizes and runtimes for each algorithm are presented, and the most recently run minimum spanning tree result is stored in 'Output.txt'. The way the Timer class is set up, this means that a minimum spanning tree of 'SanFrancisco.txt' is in 'Output.txt'.*

## How to run it
*Navigate to a folder on your computer in which you would like the project contents to go. Then run the following command: <br>*
git clone https://github.com/Pirate-Hunter-Zoro/CityConnections.git <br>
*This should create a folder named 'CityConnections'. Navigate into this folder via the terminal. Then run the command:<br>*
gradle wrapper <br>
*Once this operation completes, run the command: <br>*
./gradlew run
